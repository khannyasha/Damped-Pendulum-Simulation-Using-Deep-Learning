# Damped Pendulum Simulation Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a project that models and simulates the motion of a damped pendulum using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes Python and JAX/Flax to solve the underlying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), generate training data, train a neural network model, and visualize the results.
